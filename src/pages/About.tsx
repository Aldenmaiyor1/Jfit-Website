                            Based on theories such as NASM, ISSA, and anatomy, we aim for healthy training that reduces the risk of injury and increases exercise efficiency through numerous experiences and careers.

                            We are setting up training for various purposes by conducting scientific exercise programming according to each member's purpose and physical fitness level.

                            Classes are conducted that consider the proportional factors of the body, not just muscle exercises.
